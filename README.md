When pumping a nonlinear cystal with a CW laser is not easy to track the time distribution of detection events. It is likely to measure two consecutive detection signals in a short time window, which it is not good for some experimental setups. This is an FPGA project based on a Zynq7000 Zedboard meant to to discard consecutive detection signals.
